This study delves into the intricate relationship between subjective Airbnb reviews and objective neighborhood metrics. We collected diverse datasets, including crime statistics, transportation accessibility, demographics, socioeconomic indicators, and environmental quality, aligning them with sentiments expressed in Airbnb reviews.

Using correlation techniques—regression, clustering, and correlation coefficients—we will look at meaningful associations, highlighting how subjective perceptions align intricately with quantifiable neighborhood attributes. Visualization, including scatter plots and heatmaps, will show nuanced relationships discovered.

This integrated study enhances our understanding of how guest experiences correspond with tangible neighborhood characteristics and establishes a framework aligning review sentiments with diverse objective metrics, illuminating complex dynamics shaping urban perceptions.


##Data Collection and Analysis:
###**Crime Statistics**: Compile crime data from law enforcement to match specific neighborhoods in reviews.
###**Transportation Data**: Gather transit information, aligning it with locations mentioned in reviews.
###**Demographic Data**: Access census databases for population, income, education in reviewed neighborhoods.
###**Environmental Quality**: Obtain air quality, pollution, green space data for the neighborhoods.
###**Correlation Techniques**: Use regression, clustering, and correlation coefficients for analysis, quantifying relationships and visualizing patterns.
###**Neighborhood Metrics**: Analyze public transportation, environmental factors, urban development, and weather data to align with guest perceptions from reviews.
