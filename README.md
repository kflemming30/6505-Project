# Insights into Urban Dynamics: Analyzing Airbnb Reviews and Neighborhood Metrics

## Project Overview

This study aims to explore the relationship between subjective Airbnb reviews and objective neighborhood metrics in specific cities across the US. The project involves analyzing diverse datasets, including crime statistics, demographics & socioeconomic indicators, environmental quality, aligning them with sentiments expressed in Airbnb reviews.

### Objectives

- Investigate correlations between subjective perceptions in reviews and quantifiable neighborhood attributes within targeted US cities.
- Enhance understanding of how guest experiences align with tangible neighborhood characteristics in specific urban areas.
- Establish a framework aligning review sentiments with diverse objective metrics in the chosen cities.

### Methodologies and Tools

- **Data Collection**: Utilize Python libraries (such as Pandas and Requests) to collect and preprocess datasets.
- **Correlation Techniques**: Employ regression analysis, clustering algorithms (like K-means), and correlation coefficients to identify associations.
- **Visualization**: Use Matplotlib or Seaborn for scatter plots, heatmaps, and visual representation of relationships.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Implement TextBlob for sentiment analysis of Airbnb reviews and consider numerical ratings.

### Data Collection and Analysis

#### Crime Statistics

- **Data Collection**: Retrieve crime data from law enforcement databases.
- **Methodology**: Match crimes to specific neighborhoods mentioned in reviews using geocoding techniques.

#### Demographic and Socio-economic Data

- **Data Collection**: Access census databases for population, income, education information, cost-of-living data (housing, food cost, etc.) in reviewed neighborhoods.
- **Methodology**: Conduct demographic profiling, segmentation, regression analysis, clustering algorithms, and correlation coefficients.

#### Environmental Quality

- **Data Collection**: Obtain air quality, pollution, and green space data from environmental agencies.
- **Methodology**: Spatial analysis to correlate environmental factors with review sentiments.

#### Airbnb Review Sentiment

- **Data Collection**: Extract Airbnb review texts and numerical ratings.
- **Methodology**: Use TextBlob for sentiment analysis of review texts. Consider numerical ratings for quantitative analysis within the specified cities.

### Conclusion

This integrated study focuses on exploring the relationship between subjective Airbnb reviews and objective neighborhood metrics in specific cities across the US, aiming to illuminate the dynamics shaping urban perceptions in these selected urban areas.
