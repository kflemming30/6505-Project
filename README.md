# Insights into Urban Dynamics: Analyzing Airbnb Reviews and Neighborhood Metrics

## Project Overview

This study explores the relationship between subjective Airbnb reviews and objective neighborhood metrics in specific US cities. The analysis involves crime statistics, demographics, socioeconomic indicators, environmental quality, aligning them with sentiments expressed in Airbnb reviews.

### Objectives

- Investigate correlations between subjective reviews and quantifiable neighborhood attributes in targeted US cities.
- Understand how guest experiences align with tangible neighborhood characteristics.
- Establish a framework aligning review sentiments with diverse objective metrics in selected cities.

### Methodologies and Tools

- **Data Collection**: Utilize Python libraries (e.g., Pandas, Requests) for data collection and preprocessing.
- **Correlation Techniques**: Employ regression analysis,correlation coefficients and other analysis techniques.
- **Visualization**: Use Matplotlib or Plotly or Seaborn for visual representation of relationships.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Implement TextBlob for sentiment analysis of Airbnb reviews and consider numerical ratings.

### Data Collection and Analysis

#### Crime Statistics

- **Data Collection**: Retrieve crime data from law enforcement databases.
- **Methodology**: Match crimes to specific neighborhoods mentioned in reviews using geocoding techniques.

#### Demographic and Socio-economic Data

- **Data Collection**: Access census databases for population, income, education, and cost-of-living data in reviewed neighborhoods.
- **Methodology**: Conduct demographic profiling, segmentation, regression, and correlation analysis.

#### Environmental Quality

- **Data Collection**: Obtain air quality, pollution, or distance to beaches data.
- **Methodology**: Spatial analysis to correlate environmental factors with review sentiments.

#### Airbnb Review Sentiment

- **Data Collection**: Extract Airbnb review texts and numerical ratings.
- **Methodology**: Use TextBlob for sentiment analysis of review texts and numerical ratings for quantitative analysis.

### Conclusion

This study aims to understand how subjective Airbnb reviews align with objective neighborhood metrics in specific US cities, shedding light on the dynamics shaping urban perceptions in these areas.
