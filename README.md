Abstract:
Our study comprises two phases. Initially, we'll conduct an analysis of Airbnb ratings and reviews, including identifying common descriptors for each property/location which I'll call "vibe". For the second phase, we'll look into the correlations between Airbnb ratings, the prevailing vibe represented by key words, and a range of socio-economic factors, including the level of urbanization, cost of living, and household incomes, weather and possibly political affiliation.

In summary, our methodology entails capturing the subjective aspect through review analysis and subsequently examining the numerical relationships between Airbnb ratings and socio-economic factors. This dual-phase strategy aims to provide a nuanced understanding of how visitor satisfaction integrates with the broader socio-economic context of diverse communities.
